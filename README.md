# wp-poopify

Turn your fancy pancy Wordpress website to even better!

Baiscly what it does, it replaces every image on your website to Shit!

pls buy the premium version :(((




## hold on, whats goin on?

Well, if you didnt sense my sarcasm and immature me,
i wanted to Mock every wordpress plugins. just for example there was a plugin asking fucking `30 $` for enabling strict https on your website, with only 1-2 lines in your `apache/nginx` conf you have it for `FREE!` i honestly dont get it why people are buying that crap. Sure, you dont have always access to the config files of your host, but if your host doesnt allow or have a setting for this, Move to a diffrent host.

and no, there's no premium version of it. i just got so frustrated of wordpress plugin devs.
